# Vanilla JS based RGB guessing game

* The idea of the game is to pick one of the random generated color tiles that matches the rgb code given.
* There are two difficulty levels - EASY (3 tiles) and HARD (6 tiles).

### To-be-added in the future:
* High-scores;
* Cheat-proof the system;
* Hexadecimal color guessing mode;
